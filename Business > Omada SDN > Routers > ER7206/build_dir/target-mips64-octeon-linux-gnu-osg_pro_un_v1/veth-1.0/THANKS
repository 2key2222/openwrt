Many thanks to:

- José Luis Rey, for give me an idea (mentioning vtun) to solve the
  dilemma: obtain two or more IPs via DHCP.  This is the main idea
  behind veth

- Irving Bermúdez for testing vethd in their network.  Test was done
  transmitting 300TB of MP3 from a 386DX-20 to a Athlon-64... ;-)
  Seriously talking, he did a extensive testing, taking IPs from their
  ISP.

- You for download and test this program.
