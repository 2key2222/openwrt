      this option is used to disable flow control of this port, if this 
      product has problem that PLC bootloader continue sending PAUSE frame 
      cause gmac tx timeout.

      this option is used for products which connect phy0 directly to GMAC0 as

      in qca956x, when switch buffer if full, gmac receive PAUSE frame often cause tx 
      timeout. Base on QCA Simon suggestion, disable GMAC rxfc will let frame dropped 
      by switch instead of gmac, which avoid the driver problem.
