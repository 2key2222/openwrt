Subject: [PATCH 1468/2241] dts: sata: a3700: update sata node to connect to
 comphy handler

- the patch involve the comphy to sata.
- on A3700 the SATA comphy is configured indirectly via
  the data and address register in SATA controller, so
  there will be a register overlap between SATA driver
  and comphy driver. After check, the registers after
  data and address (from offset 0x178) for indirect access
  to comphy are not used and has no effection on SATA driver,
  so the SATA driver register space is decreased to 0x178.
